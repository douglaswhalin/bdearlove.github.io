My review has recently appeared in the *Bryn Mawr Classical Review* of David Frendo and Athanasios Fotiou, *John Kaminiates: The Capture of Thessaloniki: Translation, Introduction and Notes. Byzantina Australiensia 12.*   (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2017, availabele to read [here](http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2018/2018-06-36.html). It reads, in part:

*This volume was originally published in 2000 by the Australian Association for Byzantine Studies, and its re-release by Brill is a welcome opportunity to make the text more widely available. It contains an English translation of Kaminiates’ letter regarding the capture of Byzantine Thessalonike in 904 by the Arabs and his subsequent captivity, in parallel with the Greek text of Böhlig’s 1973 edition, accompanied by two introductions and historical notes. [. . .] As Frendo stresses in his introduction, the text is highly idiosyncratic — an epistle between two otherwise insignificant individuals. Kaminiates’ prose is vivid, and his interests quite varied. The English translation captures it well, the translators highlighting in their endnotes where difficult passages or idioms caused difficulty. [. . .] The re-release of this translation is a welcome opportunity for more scholars to become acquainted with this unique document.*
