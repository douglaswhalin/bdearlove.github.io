Tomorrow, 15 January 2019, I will be participating in the Spring ‘work-in-progress’ workshop of the [First Millennium Network]( http://firstmillenniumnetwork.org/) (formerly WARBLES), generously hosted by the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, VA. I will be sharing a revised chapter of my doctoral thesis, exploring the representation of Roman identity in a collection of seventh and eighth-century hagiographical sources, focusing on the empire’s Crimean and Armenian frontiers. Further particulars are available [here]( http://firstmillenniumnetwork.org/announcements/spring-fmn-workshop/).
