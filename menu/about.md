I am a scholar primarily focused on the Roman Empire of the Late Antique and Middle Byzantine periods (approximately AD 300-1100). My research interests include the history of the Hellenophone and Mediterranean worlds in antiquity and the early middle ages; Classical and Medieval Greek language and literary culture; and hagiography, heterodoxy, and “popular” belief in the Orthodox and Muslim worlds. My PhD thesis explored how the contours of Roman group identity changed following the initial Islamic conquest of the Middle East in the seventh century AD. Ongoing and future projects include a comparative study of literary landscape and work on ninth-century hagiographies.

As an adjunct lecturer in the Washington DC metropolitan area, I have taught a wide variety of courses covering the history and art history of Ancient Greece, Classical Rome, Late Antiquity, the Early Middle Ages, and Western Civilization. I have also taught Greek Language Greek Prose Composition to undergraduates. I work hard to integrate a wide variety of learning methods into how I approach the past, incorporating multimedia presentations, seminar-style discussions, movies, video games, and even reenacting into my classrooms.
