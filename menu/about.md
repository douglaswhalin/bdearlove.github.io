title: About Me
---
I am a scholar primarily focused on the Roman Empire of the Late Antique and Middle Byzantine periods (approximately AD 300-1100). My research interests include the history of the Hellenophone and Mediterranean worlds in antiquity and the early middle ages; Classical and Medieval Greek language and literary culture; and hagiography, heterodoxy, and “popular” belief in the Orthodox and Muslim worlds.

As an adjunct lecturer in the Washington DC metropolitan area, I have taught a wide variety of courses covering the history and art history of Ancient Greece, Classical Rome, Late Antiquity, the Early Middle Ages, and Western Civilization. I have also taught Greek Language Greek Prose Composition to undergraduates. I work hard to integrate a wide variety of learning methods into how I approach the past, incorporating movies, video games, and reenacting into my classrooms.

I moved to the DC shortly after completing my PhD following my wife for her work, which makes trips to Greece, Turkey and Italy - either for work or vacation - somewhat harder. Beyond my research and professional interests, I enjoy cycling (for commuting and pleasure), gaming with my wife, and indulging my love of small British hatchbacks.
