I am a scholar primarily focused on the Roman Empire of the Late Antique and Middle Byzantine periods (approximately AD 300-1100).
<br/>
My research interests include the history of the Hellenophone and Mediterranean worlds in antiquity and the early middle ages; Classical and Medieval Greek language and literary culture; and hagiography, heterodoxy, and “popular” belief in the Orthodox and Muslim worlds.
