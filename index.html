<h2> Hi, I'm Dr. Douglas Whalin, PhD. </h2>
<br> I'm a researcher and lecturer interested in Roman History of the Late Antique and Byzantine periods, as well as Hellenic culture generally in antiquity and the middle ages. I have taught undergraduate courses in history and classical languages, most recently at George Mason Unviersity.
<br>
<br> My wife and I moved to the Washington DC area for her work. While this makes travel to Greece, Turkey and Italy more of a challenge than I would like, the region has been full of its own delights. 
<br>
<br> Beyond my research and professional interests, I enjoy cycling (for commuting and pleasure), gaming with my wife, and indulging a love of small British hatchbacks.
