<h2> Hi, I'm Dr. Douglas Whalin, PhD. </h2>
<br> I'm a researcher and lecturer interested in Roman History of the Late Antique and Byzantine periods, as well as Hellenic culture generally in antiquity and the middle ages. I have taught undergraduate courses in history and classical languages, most recently at George Mason Unviersity.
<br>
<br> I moved to the Washington DC shortly after completing my PhD, following my wife for her work. While this makes travel to Greece, Turkey and Italy somewhat harder than it was in the UK, Washington has been full of its own delights. Beyond my research and professional interests, I enjoy cycling (for commuting and pleasure), gaming with my multi-talented wife, and indulging my love of small British hatchbacks.
