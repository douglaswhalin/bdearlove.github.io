<h2> Hi, I'm Douglas Whalin, PhD. </h2>
<br> I am a researcher and lecturer interested in Roman History of the Late Antique and Byzantine periods, as well as Hellenic culture generally in antiquity and the middle ages. I have taught undergraduate courses in history and classical languages, most recently at George Mason Unviersity.
<br>
<br> I am currently based in the Washington DC area, where I divide my time between adjunct work and research.
