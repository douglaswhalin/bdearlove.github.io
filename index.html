<h2> Hi, I'm Douglas Whalin, PhD. </h2>
<br> I am a researcher interested in Roman History of the Late Antique and Medieval periods, as well as Hellenic culture generally in antiquity and the middle ages.
<br>
<br> I am currently based in the Washington DC area, where I divide my time between adjunct work and research.
