<h2> Hi, I'm Douglas Whalin, PhD. </h2>
<br> I am a researcher interested in Roman History of the Late Antique and Medieval periods, as well as Hellenic culture generally in antiquity and the middle ages.
<br>
<h3> Research interests </h3>
<br> I am a scholar primarily focused on the Roman Empire of the Late Antique and Early Medieval periods (approximately AD 300-1100). My research interests include the history of the Hellenophone and Mediterranean worlds in antiquity and the early middle ages; Classical and Medieval Greek language and literary culture; and hagiography, heterodoxy, and 'popular' belief in the Orthodox and Muslim worlds. My PhD thesis explored how the contours of Roman group identity changed following the initial Islamic conquest of the Middle East in the seventh century AD. Ongoing and future projects include a comparative study of literary landscape and work on ninth-century hagiographies and a study of travel and travelogues in the Late Antique Aegean.
<br>
<h3> Teaching </h3>
<br> As a graduate assistant at Cambridge and now as an adjunct lecturer in the Washington DC metropolitan area, I have taught a wide variety of courses covering the history and art history of Ancient Greece, Classical Rome, Late Antiquity, and the Early Middle Ages. I have also taught a variety of Greek language and literature courses to undergraduates. I work hard to integrate a wide variety of learning methods into how I approach the past, incorporating multimedia presentations, seminar-style discussions, movies, video games, and even living history into my classrooms.
